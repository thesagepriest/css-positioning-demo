# css-positioning-demo
The purpose of this code is to show the students I am currently teaching a visual representation of how CSS position works so they know how to apply it when they start working on their projects.
Currently, the Javascript part of this code is unimportant to this lecture as I haven't started teaching them about Javascript.
